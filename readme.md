## Week 4 - Intermediate JavaScript

Dear Student of LiveCoding. Welcome to the 4th week of LiveCoding!

As you already know, the whole videos in this section are only 2 hours and 16 minutes. This is a looott less in comparison to the sections before. Why?

You will need to do a lot of, a lot of examples in order to understand these concepts. That's why we have you a bunch of algorithms that will make you think you are an [Einstein](https://img.memecdn.com/feel-like-einstein_o_502185.jpg)üßê
